# Youtuber Insights D3 Hierarchy

## About The Project

The `youtuber-insights-d3-hierarchy` repository is dedicated to visualizing global YouTuber rankings and metrics using a D3 hierarchy layout.

The statistical data used for visualizations in this project is sourced from Kaggle, a platform for predictive modelling and analytics competitions.

## Getting Started
